### Snake game played by an IA

Implementing and training a RL model to play a snake game using PyTorch

## Algorithm :

Q-Learning, from Bellman equation, Q'(s,a)= Q(s,a) + &alpha;(R(s,a) + &gamma;max(Q(s',a')))

Q: Q value

R: Reward

&alpha; : learning rate

&gamma; : parameter to controle the randomness < 1
